## Hytte layout

{% include image.html url="pics/eikebu_layout.png" description="Very approximate floorplan." %}
Note: floor plan created in [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GnS3w3ZwJAhUoVCKrsrTRdfcdq47Z_Wrvkc5c-I2RoI/edit?usp=sharing).

Red boxes mark position of things you *must* unplug before leaving - the fridge and the space heater.

  * Unplug the fridge and *leave the door open* so it doesn't get mouldy
  * Unplug the space heater (as marked on [floor plan](#hytte-layout))
  * Make sure the light in Stabur is turned off (light switch just inside door)
* Fill up / Dump all water buckets and jugs (see [water](#water))

  * The well padlock (labelled Well)
  * Stabur

## Hygiene

### Toilet

#### Highly recommended

* Sprinkly a layer of bark into the bucket when you first arrive to avoid later stickiness
* Don't be stingy with the bark!
* Pee elsewhere - if you don't want to use the woods, use the Loo with a View!

The toilet is equipped with

* A red bucket with ~clean water (easiest to refill at boat launch)
* A basin & soap for washing your hands (toss grey water into woods)
* Spare toilet paper in the blue cupboard under the basin
* **Bark** and trowel - always sprinkle over waste to minimise smells
* All of this can be left there when closing up

To empty the bucket:

* Dig the pit
  * Choose a patch of ~flat ground, reasonably far from any buildings - and the well! Preferably by the fence
  * Mark out a ~3' square
  * Remove the sod - this may be easier in 1' x 1' (x ~4" thick) chunks
  * Dig to ~18" depth
  * Bring secateurs to help cut through roots
* Grab the bucket via the flap on the western wall, and empty it into the pit
  * Helpful to prop up the flap with a useful stick
  * If enough bark has been used, it shouldn't be too wet or smelly!
* Fill in the pit, and replace the sod
* Rinse out the bucket in the lake (preferably east of Hytte given the prevailing longshore drift)
  * Put in a few handfuls of pebbles and swirl around to get rid of anything tough

### Rubbish

There are a few big bins at Hyllbrua (7718 Steinkjer, Norway) - both rubbish and recycling. Any bottles or cans can be returned at any supermarket to redeem the deposit.

### Laundry

* Twin-tub washing machine is stored in Stabur
* Before use, place on the porch east of kitchen door
  * Hose plugs into lower left side of machine, drain into a tub on the steps to the porch
  * For power, plug in via extension cord (stored XXX)
* To wash:
  * Fill left tub with clothes, warm (not hot!) water, and detergent
  * Turn leftmost timer to run washing tub for however many minutes you want
  * Drain water (middle knob)
  * Move clothes to right tub for spin cycle (rightmost timer)
    * There's a little plastic topper that goes directly on top of your clothes within the spinner
    * We ran the spin cycle in a few batches of ~3 minutes
    * It should spin smoothly and fairly quietly - if it is thumping around, open the lid, press out some of the water, and rearrange the load
  * Move clothes back to washing tub and fill with clean water to rinse
  * Repeat spin cycle to dry
* Washing line and clothes pegs are stored behind the door between the kitchen and living room
  * If raining, there are some bent nails placed around the southwestern corner of the living room around ~6' high to hang the line from

### Shower

* Portable shower is stored in the NW corner of the living room
  * Charges via USB-A: make sure to properly replace waterproof cap onto charge port
* Fill the black bucket with the string attached to the handle with water (1 kettle hot water + 2/3 cold water)
* Hang bucket on the nail on the southeast corner of Hytte (eastern wall)
* Hang plastic holder and shower head on the plastic suction cup nailed to the southern edge of that corner
* Put pump into bucket, and press power button (under cap)

## Food and Drink

### Water

Typically, reserve the metal buckets for drinking (well) water, and the plastic buckets for washing (lake) water.

To get drinking water:

* Bring out the large plastic water jug (rectangular) - stored on the southern end of the kitchen counter
* Bring out a funnel (top part of a Solo bottle) - stored in a bucket under the stairs
* Bring out a metal bucket - stored under the stairs
* Unhook the pole with carabiners on the end from the metal hook on the vertical pole; clip the metal bucket on
* Open the well door and take the lid off the well
* Lower the bucket on the pole down to the well water - to fill the bucket, you may have to swish it back and forth
* Bring up the bucket, and pour into the water jug - it takes ~4 buckets to fill
* Replace the lid, close the door, and rehook the pole with carabiners onto the vertical pole

Hack for washing water: if its rainy, place buckets under roof drips in front of the porch - they fill up quickly!

### Cooking

#### Mum's oven thing

???

#### BBQ and Smoker

There is a BBQ and a smoker - the smoker is a bit shit.

#### Misc

* Coffee-making
  * Aeropress, cafetiere
  * Manual coffee grinder (big wooden ones)


## Flag

There's some tradition of flying a different flag on the day you arrive, and on Sundays, but that's a pain - especially if its raining. There's a penant kept rolled up on top of the medicine cabinet on the south wall of the living room.

To hoist the flag

* Untie the two ends of the halyard, and retie to the flag using a [sheet bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/sheet-bend-knot) or similar
  * Be careful not to lose hold of an untied end!
* Hoist the flag
  * If you are a proper boy scout, there is a way to do this to make it unfurl properly
* Secure the end with a [cleat hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/cleat-hitch-halyard-knot)

When lowering the flag, tie the two ends together with an [overhand bend](https://www.animatedknots.com/flat-overhand-bend-knot) and secure to the pole with the [cleat hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/cleat-hitch-halyard-knot)
